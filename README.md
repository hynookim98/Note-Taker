# Note-Taker

## Description 
Hello my name is Matthew Kim and I am a beginner programmer studying at the UCI coding Bootcamp. This program was created to be able to keep track of a users' notes and ideas with a clean and polished UI for the user to interact with. This program was deployed through Heroku and the link for the program can be found here: 

Here is a screenshot of the deployed program in the browser.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my code and use my program!

## Installation 
To use the program you need to install express and uuid which is already in the package.json from the terminal. You can run 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies if you wish to launch the program through your own terminal. 

## Usage 
To use the program just visit the deployed link and add a note. The program will not let you add a note if there is no title or no message. Both is required. You are able to delete a note once done. At the moment there is no function to edit a post once posted.
